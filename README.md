This is a memory game that will generate pseudo random numbers from holding a button and display them in a sequence on 7 segment displays on the DE-10 lite board.
The player then has to imitate the pattern and try to copy the pattern and as they make successful guesses the word NICE will show up and each letter will pop up for 
each right number guessed in the pattern
